            This first part of the course has been insightful.
            I've learned PHP and improved my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            For the project, I focused on minimizing JavaScript usage and relying more on PHP. <br><br>
            Teamwork went well—my partner and I split tasks clearly: each person handled specific website functionalities to avoid code conflicts and maintain clear ownership.

            Bugs were inevitable. The timer functionality was particularly tricky—I confused local time with UTC time.
            Debugging was the least enjoyable part. The profile image upload took the most time, with many issues to resolve. <br> <br>
            The course might have benefited from introducing databases earlier.
            Without one, we had to use hacky solutions like storing passwords in text or JSON files (not ideal).
        </p>
        <p>
            We managed our time well, finishing 90%+ of the website a week before the deadline.
            PHP feels a bit clunky with some obscure and esoteric features, but I still enjoy using it.
            Looking forward to the database portion next.
